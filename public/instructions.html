<h2>Description and links</h2>

<div>This app will allow you to connect to a SMART protected server, and execute queries against that server. There are a
couple of servers already configured (the SMART test site and the clinFHIR server - under development), but you can easily add
other servers as needed.</div>
<div></div>

<h3>Links (open in new tab)</h3>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/index.html">FHIR Specification</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/">SMART Specification</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Quick start instructions</h2>

<h3>To connect to a server</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Select the server in the left panel, then click the 'Login' button to start the connection process.</li>

    <li>If the callback is not correct (ie it doesn't match the one exposed by the local server) then you'll get an error
message and the process will top. Otherwise, the app will read the CapabilityStatement from the server root to get
    the SMART endpoints exposed by the remote server, then the iFrame (this window) will be re-directed to the SMART
Authorization end point as per the specification.</li>
    <li>Progress will be displayed on the left side. If there are errors, then they will displayed either here, or in the iFrame</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add a new server to the list</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click the 'cog' icon to the upper right, and select the 'Edit server list' option. A dialog with all the currently configured servers
    will be displayed</li>
    <li>To add a new server, you must first have registered this app with the SMART server, and have a login to the SMART server if
        it requires it. This process will depend on the SMART server.</li>
    <li>To add a configuration to the app,
        click the 'Add' button at the top left above the list of servers. The right tab will display a form with inputs
        for each option. The following values can be entered through the SMART configuration tab:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>name</strong> for the server config. This will appear in the list to the left, and should be unique in the list</li>
        <li>An optional <strong>description</strong> of the configuration</li>
        <li>The <strong>base url</strong> to the SMART servers endpoint. This is where the FHIR server is located. Be sure to include the trailing '/'</li>
        <li>The <strong>callback url</strong>. This is where the SMART server will redirect the browser to after authentication. The value is pre-populated (as
            it is exposed by this app, and it must match one of the callbacks registered in the SMART server.</li>
        <li>The <strong>client id</strong>. This must be the same as the one assigned by the SMART server when the app was registered</li>
        <li>If you have specified that this app is a confidential one (It isn't really as the config data is stored in the
        browser - but that doesn't matter for testing) then enter the <strong>secret</strong> that was supplied by the SMART server.</li>
        <li>The <strong>default scope</strong> for the app. This can be changed when actually making the call.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>You can also enter your login credentials and notes about the server in the 'User details & Notes' tab. These are just for your
    convenience and are not sent to the server</li>
    <li>Click the 'Update list' button at the upper right to save. (The whole list is updated)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit an existing server</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click the 'cog' icon to the upper right, and select the 'Edit server list' option. A dialog with all the currently configured servers
        will be displayed</li>
    <li>Select the entry you wish to change, and update as required (see notes above).</li>
    <li>Click 'Update list' to save.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remove a server</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click the 'cog' icon to the upper right, and select the 'Edit server list' option. A dialog with all the currently configured servers
        will be displayed</li>
